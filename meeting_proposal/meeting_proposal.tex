\section{A meeting structure proposal}

\begin{frame}{Ideas of meetings}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What should be communicated in a meeting?
        \item What would you like to take away from a meeting?
        \item How often and when should everybody present?
        \item Do you feel like you understand most discussions in a meeting?
        \item Do you feel comfortable presenting your work and asking questions and if not why?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My answers}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In a meeting a status update should be given and it should be communicated how is working on what and where the difficulties lie.
        \item I like to be updated on general things and I need the meeting to understand who might need my help.
        \item I think a presentation should either by very brief and every or every second week or only when one has really new results or questions. I would like a soft obligation to present once a month.
        \item I now understand almost all discussions. Halfway through my Master a lot of topics were not clear to me. In Zoom meetings I find it harder to listen.
        \item I feel comfortable presenting, sometimes I dislike speaking for too long when the meeting is already long.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A suggestion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add timeslots to the meeting to allow better planning of the allocated time.
        \item Add a Jira to improve the planning of tasks and streamline the reports
        \item Use Jira to have discussions and keep them available
        \item Maybe use a loose Sprint structure to decide for presentation deadlines
        \item What do you think?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
