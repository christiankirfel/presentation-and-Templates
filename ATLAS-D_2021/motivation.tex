\begin{frame}{Initial problems}
    \begin{block}{Obstacles of optimisation processes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Grid searches are both tedious and ressource intensive
            \item Knowledge gained in one problem is rarely universal
            \item Experienced users can develop a bias towards certain hyperparamters
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Making machine learning more accesible to students}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Physics students need increasingly high programming skills
            \item Most students actively search this challenge but appreciate the rewarded of early results
            \item Desirable to create a framework that is easy to use and allows to face some challenges later on
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Goals}
    \begin{block}{Network optimisation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create an algorithm more efficient than a grid search
            \item The algorithm should be unbiased and avoiding local minima
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Accesibility}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A new user should have easy access
            \item The challenges for a new user should be small enough to allow a feeling of achievment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{BAF compatability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The algorithm should utilize the BAF worker node structure
            \item Ideally it should be efficient enough to create satisfying results on CPUs
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Evolutionary optimisation of neural networks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combination of a grid searches with a survival of the fittest setup
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Start with a number of random hyperparamters
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Evaluate the set of hyperparameters
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Create a a new set of networks based on the previous best
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Add recombination and variation to avoid local minima and bias
    \end{itemize}
