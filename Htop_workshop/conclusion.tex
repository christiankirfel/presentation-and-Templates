\begin{frame}{Conclusion and future steps}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both neural network and BDT show very good separation for an early stage of optimisation
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item For the lepditau channel the separation is outstanding but the stability is bad. This means the agreement between training and validation is often bad
        or has regions that are not understood.
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item In both cases the variables have a significant impact on the result. Different sets of features need to be explored to find better separations.
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item A decorrelation and ranking would be desireable
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item The handling of negative weights is an ongoing problem that needs to be investigated to see if a conclusion can be reached for MVA techniques.
