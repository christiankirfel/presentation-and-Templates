\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Using neural networks for signal to background separation in the \tHq channel is an interesting analysis that offers many challenges.
        \item Negative weights resulting from Monte Carlo generators cannot easily be handled by machine learning algorithms.
        \item Different sizes of background samples result in smaller backgrounds getting ignored or even classified as signal
        \item Evolutionary optimisation of neural networks is a nice approach to reoptimise a network automatically in an ongoing analysis.
