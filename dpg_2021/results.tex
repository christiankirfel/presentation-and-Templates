\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Neural networks in the \tHq channel is a \textbf{challenging} analysis.

        \item \textbf{Negative} weights resulting from Monte Carlo generators \textbf{cannot} easily be handled by machine learning algorithms.
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Different sizes of background samples result in smaller backgrounds getting \textbf{ignored} or even \textbf{misclassified} as signal.
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item Evolutionary optimisation of neural networks is a nice approach to \textbf{reoptimise} a network \textbf{automatically}.
