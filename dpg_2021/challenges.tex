    \begin{block}{Handling of negative weights}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the origin of negative3 weights
            \item How do they affect neural networks
            \item How should they be handled
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Weighting of background processes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dominating background can diminish the significance of secondary backgrounds in Training
            \item Adjust the network to handle several levels of background.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Accelerating network optimisation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exploration of new features is only possible in an optimised network
            \item To minimise the work of constant optimisation
        \end{itemize}
