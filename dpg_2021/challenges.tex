    \begin{block}{Negative weights in Monte Carlo}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Negative weights arise from
            \item In neural network training negative weights need to an unwanted behaviour
            \item The impact of the treatment of negative weights on the training has to be explored
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Different sizes of background processes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dominating background can diminish the significance of secondary backgrounds in Training
            \item Especially very signal-like backgrounds are likely to be mislabed
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Accelerating network optimisation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exploration of new features is only possible in an optimised network
            \item An evolutionary optimisation approach minimises the work effort
        \end{itemize}
